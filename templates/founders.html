        "I believe that psychotherapy is a process to achieve results from the interaction between the client and the therapist in the most <span class="font-animation">empathetic and non-judgemental form,</span> I consider both the <span class="font-animation">client and the therapist to be in equal positions</span> without establishing any sense of authority one over another.  I intend to work in the setup of psychotherapy to explore the <span class="font-animation">dynamics of the psyche on both ends of the table.</span>

        I have worked for over <span class="font-animation">1200 hours of intense psychotherapy</span> with problems related to <span class="font-animation">relationships, commitment, parent-child interaction, existential crisis, sleep, work motivation, family crisis, sexual discontentment, abuse, and trauma.</span>

    <p class="introduction-text" style="margin-top: 0 !important; padding-top: 0 !important; padding-bottom: 0 !important;">
        The concerns that I have previously worked with range from <span class="font-animation">Neurodivergence, depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Anxiety, Dissociation, Post-Traumatic Stress, Schizophrenia, Borderline Personality, and Narcissistic personality to Avoidant personality.</span>

        My specialization of models in psychotherapy includes psychoanalysis, clinical hypnotherapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, dialectical Behavior therapy, cognitive behavior therapy, art therapy, techniques of mindfulness, EFT, anger management, assertiveness-communication training, and Relaxation exercises.
        I am a <span class="font-animation">trauma informed, queer Affirmative and a spirituality-inclusive, Clinical Psychologist</span> with pronouns she/her. I hold a valid practicing <span class="font-animation">license registered with the Rehabilitation Council of India (RCI)</span> with CRR no. A89424.

        I have majored in the field of Clinical Psychology with an intention of dealing with a specific clientele which requires serious help with diagnosable conditions and disorders along with the assessment process of these disorders. I believe in <span class="font-animation">psychotherapy as a crucial weapon that deserves a place in all our toolboxes</span> to deal with the more complicated and advanced stressors in the environment of the modern day scenario."
